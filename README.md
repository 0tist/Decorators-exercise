# Decorators-exercise

Hey everyone!

In order to better understand the functioning of libraries, it is essential to understand a few basic concepts of OOPS, one of them is `Decorators}`.<br>
I find myself contantly looking at libraries such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [Fastai](https://www.fast.ai) to make use. of them in my projects.<br>
I suggest the use of decorators to make your code productive, expandable, and easy to read and interact.<br>

Decorators essentially gives us the ability to wrap our functions to add/improve their functionality. It's like adding cheese layers on a pizza(you want more of it, but not too much :p)<br>
Moving on, I haven't shared all the nitty gritty details of decorators, but it is enough for you to understand how libraries are structured and how you can use them in your projects. I've divided the tutorial in 4 segmments starting from the essence of the decorators to its use cases. I'll be adding my future findings of decorators as well to keep y'all upto the speed :) <br>

Also, the repo is heavily inspired from [primer on python decorators by Real Python](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) in case you want to dig depper, i suggest going through their blog
